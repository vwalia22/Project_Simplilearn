This is my project where all the learners will follow the below steps

1.  	Fork my project
2.  	Clone to local
3.  	Modify the file by adding your name in the last line
4.  	Once done - add >> commit >> push to remote
5.  	Once the push is successful create a pull request from github
6.  	I will accept the pull request and we will see how the process goes.
7.  	Now you will create a new branch in local and push the same to remote - add a file with some text
8.  	Then create a pull request and I will decide to accept or reject.
9.  	Create another branch and name it as â€“ branch2
10.   Now modify the branch2 and commit and push to remote again
11.   Now on local go to branch2 and rebase the branch1 to branch2 and then push it again.
12.   Once done, raise a pull request again and I will accept or reject the same.
